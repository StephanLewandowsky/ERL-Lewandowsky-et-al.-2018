I attached you the forcing correction file I received from Markus. The values are absolute global mean surface air temperature from 1850 - 2012 with different forcing combinations. 

The columns are: 

- RF_1a:  RCP85 (volc) and RCP85 (solar)
- RF_1b:  RCP85 (volc) and ACRIM (solar)
- RF_1c:  RCP85 (volc) and PMOD (solar)
- RF_2a:  GISS (volc) and RCP85 (solar)
- RF_2b:  GISS (volc) and ACRIM (solar)
- RF_2c:  GISS (volc) and PMOD (solar)
- RF_3a:  GISS_BACKGROUND (volc) and RCP85 (solar)
- RF_3b:  GISS_BACKGROUND (volc) and ACRIM (solar)
- RF_3c:  GISS_BACKGROUND (volc) and PMOD (solar)

For the hiatus review Reto sent to you we assumed a constant forcing correction for the three years after 2012. Markus forcing adjustment does not include tropospheric aerosols, while I believe Schmidt et al. included updated nitrate forcing estimates and an update for the Pinatubo eruption (if I remember correctly). According to a recent assessment, the contribution of tropospheric aerosols during the hiatus period, however, might even be slightly positive, but the spread among different models is large (https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/2709/2017/)  (and for the full CMIP5 model spread this would probably be even larger, given how much the models differ in aerosol representation and inclusion of indirect aerosol effects). 

From Huber14 paper:
"The RCP forcing data set constitutes also the reference case in terms of
stratospheric aerosol, which is based on previous volcanic stratospheric aerosol
data used in the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) climate model up to the year 2001,
followed by zero forcing to the year 2005 (ref. 26). Here, we use updated optical
thickness time series (\tau) from NASA GISS (accessed at
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelforce/strataer/tau.line_2012.12.txt) and convert
them to radiative forcing with a conversion factor of -23.5Wm^2\tau^{-1}, denoted by
GISS in Fig. 2b. We further account for an additional negative radiative forcing
during the period 1960-1990 of about -0.1Wm^2 suggested by observations (Solomon et al., 2011),
denoted by GISS-BACKGROUND."

Outten et al. (2015) and Thorne et al. (2015) also applied updated forcings to NorESM (see their papers attached), maybe that is also useful for your model-observation comparison.
